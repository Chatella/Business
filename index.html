  <h3> Informational Interview</h3>
  <p>
  I interviewed Amy Stegmuller who works at Liebherr as the Vice President of the Automation Sector. I asked her questions about what makes a potential candidate hirable. I asked her what she values when hiring someone, what personal assets she feels are most important, and what advice she has on being a successful individual.
  </p>
  <p>
  She believes that there are many characteristics and traits that should be valued when looking at people to hire. Being a team player who cooperates with others is a priority to her, though. She looks for someone who isn’t just interested in getting all the credit, but sees the importance of the team or business doing well as a whole. Another point that was talked about was being eager and having a thirst for knowledge or being curious about the industry and your customers. Being self-driven was also an important trait she mentioned.
  </p>
  <p>
  When it comes to personal assets, she feels that experience is one of the most important things to have. Showing that you know what you are talking about and can work well under certain circumstances is key to getting a job. Surprisingly, she mentions that she believes your network is one of the least important. She states that she thinks this because a network is always changing and can be built throughout your life and shouldn’t be a priority. She talks about being self-aware, as well. It is crucial to understand what your weaknesses and strengths are, and to use it to better yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
  Her main advice on how to be successful was to know how to listen. Listening effectively is key to being a good employee, especially when it comes to business. Being able to hear and understand a customer’s needs before jumping into a sales pitch can drastically change how effectively you do your job. Communication skills along with research will get you far. It is important to listen to yourself to know what you personally need, as well. She also points out that education is wonderful, but experience is better so work hard to get your foot in the door and not be scared to take advantage of opportunities. 
  </p>
  <p>
  What I learned from her was that communication, especially listening, and taking advantage of any opportunities presented to me are important to being successful and hirable. I am excited to use this knowledge moving forward, and to get started in my business career. Even though she mentioned your network being the least important personal asset, I am glad to have her as a mentor.
