      What I Learned From My Principles of Business Management Class
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a>During this class, I have learned a lot. One of the most important things for me to work on, I have realized, is my time management and planning skills. I want to be able to complete my goals effectively and efficiently. Throughout this class, I’ve learned practices that can help me do just that.
      </a><br><br>
<a>From the very beginning of this class, I learned about time management. The first Discussion Board assignment had to do with how you spend your time. The video accompanying the assignment used a metaphor for the goals you have in life. “Big rocks” represented big and important goals, “little rocks” represented semi-important goals, and “sand” represented everything else in your day to day life. If you focused on sand and little rocks first, you would often not have time for big rocks but if you start by focusing on big rocks, you could often fit everything in after. This taught me that prioritizing and organizing your day by focusing on big goals will lead to the most productivity.
    </a><br><br>
<a>I learned that in order to succeed in my personal and professional life, I need to prioritize. I need to work on school, and my income in order to even worry about what comes next. During this quarantine period, I have spent more time on my phone than ever. Instead of focusing on what I could do, I worried about what I couldn’t. Now I wake up, start my day with a coffee, and my laptop in front of me to focus on my priorities. This has helped me feel better about what I am doing while seeing real results.
    </a><br><br>
<a>From this day forward, I will organize my goals, and work on starting each day on the right foot. Each morning I will ask myself what needs to be done and prioritize those items. I will then focus on the biggest and most important tasks. After that, I can worry about everything else, such as social life, and leisure activities. This will help me see what I’m doing and be proud of my accomplishments. I will be able to stand by what I am doing and lead with authenticity.
    </a><br><br>
<a>This class, Principles of Business Management, has taught me a lot. I know that I must prioritize and organize my time. My goals are manageable if I do this. This also teaches me how to be a better leader and manager. If I push myself to do this, I can lead with authenticity and by example.

      Management Philosophy
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a>During my time as a leader, I have noticed that many companies lack employee motivation. One thing I’ve learned to do is set goals and offer feedback to my employees and coworkers. Goal Setting Theory states that people have goals that energize them and direct their thoughts and behavior towards those goals. It’s also important to feel those goals are attainable and to reach some every now and then to feel productive.
      </a><br><br>
<a>When employees aren’t motivated, productivity and morale can get very low. You’ll see people feeling like they are working hard without reaching any goals, and people wanting to leave your establishment from the sense of disarray. It is important to give feedback to employees to let them know whether they are doing what they are supposed to, or not, and to keep goals measurable and attainable so that feedback is possible.

  <h3> Informational Interview</h3>
  <p>
    <a>
  I interviewed Amy Stegmuller who works at Liebherr as the Vice President of the Automation Sector. I asked her questions about what makes a potential candidate hirable. I asked her what she values when hiring someone, what personal assets she feels are most important, and what advice she has on being a successful individual.
    </a><br><br>
  <a>She believes that there are many characteristics and traits that should be valued when looking at people to hire. Being a team player who cooperates with others is a priority to her, though. She looks for someone who isn’t just interested in getting all the credit, but sees the importance of the team or business doing well as a whole. Another point that was talked about was being eager and having a thirst for knowledge or being curious about the industry and your customers. Being self-driven was also an important trait she mentioned.
    </a><br><br>
  <a>When it comes to personal assets, she feels that experience is one of the most important things to have. Showing that you know what you are talking about and can work well under certain circumstances is key to getting a job. Surprisingly, she mentions that she believes your network is one of the least important. She states that she thinks this because a network is always changing and can be built throughout your life and shouldn’t be a priority. She talks about being self-aware, as well. It is crucial to understand what your weaknesses and strengths are, and to use it to better yourself.
    </a><br><br>
  <a>Her main advice on how to be successful was to know how to listen. Listening effectively is key to being a good employee, especially when it comes to business. Being able to hear and understand a customer’s needs before jumping into a sales pitch can drastically change how effectively you do your job. Communication skills along with research will get you far. It is important to listen to yourself to know what you personally need, as well. She also points out that education is wonderful, but experience is better so work hard to get your foot in the door and not be scared to take advantage of opportunities. 
    </a><br><br>
  <a>What I learned from her was that communication, especially listening, and taking advantage of any opportunities presented to me are important to being successful and hirable. I am excited to use this knowledge moving forward, and to get started in my business career. Even though she mentioned your network being the least important personal asset, I am glad to have her as a mentor.

    <h3>Fearless Leadership</h3>
    <p>
      <a>From: Amy Chatell</a> <br>
      <a>To: Whom it may concern</a><br>
      <a>Date: 07/24/2020</a> <br>
      <a>Subject: Book Analysis</a><br><br>

<a>I read the book Fearless Leadership: Part I by Carey Lohrenz. In this book, she talks about things that make a fearless leader. Her three main characteristics included courage, tenacity, and integrity. Carey Lohrenz is a former lieutenant in the U.S. Navy who was the first fully qualified female naval aviator to fly the F-14 Tomcat in the U.S. military, and a speaker/consultant on matters regarding business leadership.</a><br><br>

<a>Courage is not the ability to have no fear. It’s the ability to have fear and be brave enough to do what you need to do, regardless. She talks about many things but one thing that stood out to me was her take on something she called “limiting beliefs.” These are things that have been ingrained in us throughout our lives. Whether it’s criticism from a parent, a teacher, or your peers, it can stick with us for a long time. It’s our responsibility to realize that our fears may not be true, and to fight the voices telling us that we cannot do something.
      </a><br><br>
<a>Tenacity is the ability to persevere through difficult times. Courage can get you started, but tenacity takes you to the finish line. She states “if you’re looking to separate yourself from your peers, you need to be willing to outwork them.” When you are a leader, you have to often lead by example. This means doing the work, and continuing even when the road gets rocky. Often times, we have the courage to start something but lack the ability to keep going and not turn back when the going gets tough. This is where tenacity comes in.
      </a><br><br>
<a>Integrity is doing the right thing. Also being authentic to yourself. Integrity ties into tenacity by giving you the goal to reach for, and the right reasons to push through. There is a quote in the book that states “Integrity is one of those words that many people keep in the desk drawer labeled “too hard.” . . . When supported with education, a person’s integrity can give him something to rely on when perspective seems to blur, when rules and principles seem to waver, and when he’s faced with hard choices of right or wrong” (Vice Admiral James Bond Stockdale, USN). Having integrity is important in leadership and will keep you on track to success.
      </a><br><br>
<a>This book was incredibly helpful, and I believe it would be a good read for anyone looking to be a leader. Specifically a fearless one. She offers advice from her time in the military and examples from real leaders in our country. It taught me a lot about how courage, tenacity, and integrity will play a role in whether or not I am successful in my personal or professional life.
